Designed a Verilog-based PWM generator to smoothly increase and decrease LED brightness without abrupt
transitions
∗ Integrated UART interface for real-time brightness control using serial communication
∗ Simulated and synthesized the design using Vivado, verifying PWM waveform and UART functionality on FPGA
